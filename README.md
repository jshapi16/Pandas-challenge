# Pandas-challenge
A Pandas data analysis challenge


This project analyzes customer purchase data for an independent gaming company, Heros of Pymoli. The game is free to play but there are in-app purchases available for players.

This project compares and contrasts male to female purchases and age groups purchases to find purchase count and price for each of the potential add ons.
